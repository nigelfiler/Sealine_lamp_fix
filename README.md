The cabin downlights in Sealine boats tend to become fragile over time, causing the diffuser fitting to no longer stay securely in place. 
Since replacement fittings are no longer available, this repository provides a 3D-printable part that can be super-glued in as a repair. 
The part was generously designed and shared by a member of the Sealine Forum. 
Unfortunately, I canâ€™t recall his name, but he deserves full credit for this helpful contribution. 

The black foam ring also tends to become fragile over time. A suitable replacement can be found on eBay under the name "Sponge Cord Black Foam Rubber Gasket, 5mm." 
Simply cut it to the required length and join the ends with superglue.

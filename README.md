The cabin downlights in Sealine boats tend to become fragile over time, causing the fittings to no longer stay securely in place. 
Since replacement fittings are no longer available, this repository provides a 3D-printable part that can be super-glued in as a repair. 
The part was generously designed and shared by a member of the Sealine Forum. 
Unfortunately, I canâ€™t recall his name, but he deserves full credit for this helpful contribution.
